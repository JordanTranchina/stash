    "excerpt": "For 92 minutes on a clear Sunday morning in Taipei, thousands of spectators with jittery nerves stared upwards, while people across the world were glued to their screens, as famed climber Alex Honnold made a death-defying attempt to scale one of the tallest skyscrapers on Earth.",
    "content": "Taipei, Taiwan\n\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\n\nFor 92 minutes on a clear Sunday morning in Taipei, thousands of spectators with jittery nerves stared upwards, while people across the world were glued to their screens, as famed climber [Alex Honnold made a death-defying attempt to scale](https://www.cnn.com/sport/live-news/taiwan-alex-honnold-climb-taipei-101-01-25-26-intl-hnk) one of the tallest skyscrapers on Earth.\n\nHe clambered up the last inch of the metal spire atop Taipei 101 at 10:43 am local time and stood on the 1,667-foot (508-meters) summit with a grin, waving to the cheering fans below \u2013 a sight that will undoubtedly become an iconic moment in climbing folklore.\n\nHe\u2019s the first known climber to free solo Taipei 101, meaning an ascent without ropes, safety nets, or other equipment \u2013 just his bare hands and a chalk bag to help with grip.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be glowing for days, it\u2019s incredible,\u201d Honnold said in a news conference after finishing the climb. \u201cYou spend so long thinking about it and imagining it\u2019s possible, but then to actually do it always feels different.\u201d\n\nHonnold, 40, has been a recognized figure in the climbing community for nearly two decades \u2013 rising to prominence in his early 20s for successful free solo climbs of challenging routes.\n\nBut he became a household name worldwide after becoming the first person to free climb El Capitan, a vertical rock formation at Yosemite National Park, in 2017 \u2013 a nail-biting ascent that was captured in the award-winning documentary \u201cFree Solo.\u201d\n\nSince then, he has [continued climbing and setting new records](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/25/sport/alex-honnold-greenland-climbing-intl-spt-climate). Despite having had his eyes on Taipei 101 for more than a decade, the opportunity never materialized until it was pitched to Netflix, which live-streamed his ascent. Honnold called it \u201cthe biggest urban free solo climb ever.\u201d\n\nThe climb was meant to happen Saturday morning local time, but was rescheduled due to poor weather. Sunday dawned sunny and clear with blue skies and little wind, allowing the climb to go ahead.\n\n\u201cFor me, personally, the biggest challenge was staying calm. Having the crowd, having the whole experience, having all the people around just made it feel a little more intense,\u201d he added. \u201cBut as I climbed, I relaxed more and more, like, \u2018Oh, this is so fun, this is why I do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not the first person to climb Taipei 101: French climber Alain Robert summited the building in 2004, but with ropes. Robert had been invited to climb it as part of the building\u2019s official public opening, but conditions were far worse that day, with rain and heavy winds \u2013 making his climb four hours long, compared to Honnold\u2019s one and a half hours.\n\nBoth Robert and Honnold described the ascent as not overly challenging or complicated compared to the usual rock formations and mountains they climb. For instance, Honnold wasn\u2019t holding onto the sheer slippery glass of the skyscraper \u2013 he had metal structures, ledges and beams to hold onto.\n\nThere were several more technically difficult moves toward the top. But Honnold cleared those without much difficulty, moving up the building at a rapid pace. At points, he stopped on balconies to take a break and wave at the crowd below.\n\nHis nervous wife Sanni McCandless was watching from inside Taipei 101, waving to her husband on the other side of the glass as he passed her floor on his way up. After he summitted, she met him at a balcony below the spire, embracing him and joking: \u201cI was basically having a panic attack the entire time.\u201d\n\nWhen it opened in 2004, Taipei 101 was the tallest building in the world \u2013 a title it held until it was usurped by Dubai\u2019s 2717-foot (828-meter) Burj Kalifa. Ten other buildings taller than Taipei 101 have since been built, including New York\u2019s One World Trade Center, but it remains a spectacle in Taipei as it is the tallest building in the city.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s President Lai Ching-te was quick to congratulate Honnold on his \u201ctruly nerve-wracking\u201d spectacle. He hoped the event would allow the world to see \u201cthe warmth of the Taiwanese people and the island\u2019s beautiful hills and landscapes,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the climb, Honnold said he hoped people watching could be inspired by his climb to pursue their own challenges or goals. And, in his signature matter-of-fact way, he summed up his achievement with few words:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so great. What a nice day.\u201d",

The airport is closed.\n\nThe FAA and NTSB will investigate the crash, according to a statement from the FAA.\n\nThe crash comes amid a massive snowstorm making its way through the Northeast. Temperatures are well below freezing in Maine, with light snow causing very low visibility.\n\nThe plane is registered to a limited liability corporation in Houston, according to federal records.\n\nMinutes before the crash, controllers and pilots at Bangor Airport can be heard talking about low visibility and deicing, though it is not immediately clear who is talking to whom, according to audio obtained from [LiveATC.net](http://liveatc.net/).\n\nA controller clears the pilot for takeoff on Bangor\u2019s Runway 33.\n\nNearly two minutes later, a controller loudly radios: \u201cAll traffic is stopped on the field! All traffic is stopped on the field!\u201d\n\nMoments later, another controller is heard saying, \u201cAircraft upside down. We have a passenger aircraft upside down.\u201d\n\nThe airport is then closed, and emergency vehicles are allowed to drive on the airfield.\n\nA controller later states they are aware of \u201cthree crew and possibly five passengers\u201d on board.\n\n*This is a developing story and will be updated.*",

    "content": "Unlike their bagged, corded siblings, the best cordless stick vacuums are compact and lightweight cleaning powerhouses. Cordless stick vacuums are slim but powerful enough to tackle most jobs around [smaller homes](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/home), apartments and college dorm rooms. Some of these vacuums even excel at challenging tasks like vacuuming [pet hair](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/pets).\n\nOur team has [reviewed](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews) various vacuum models for years, including [handheld vacuums](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum), [upright vacuums](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-upright-vacuum-cleaner) and [canister vacuums](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-canister-vacuum), as well as [robot vacuums](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-robot-vacuum) and [robot mops](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-robot-mop). They can all help make cleaning your home easier. In the case of upright and canister vacuums, however, it can sometimes be a pain to deal with their heavy vacuum bodies, cords and bags. This is where the best cordless stick vacuum comes in handy.\n\nTo find the [best vacuum](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-vacuum-cleaner) for you, we tested 14 highly rated cordless stick vacuums to assess their performance, suction power, ease of use and battery life. We used each cordless stick vacuum to suck up pet fur, cat litter and pine needles, along with all the dirt and debris that\u2019s left behind daily. Once testing concluded, three models stood out from the pack.\n\n[Dyson V15s Detect Submarine Absolute Wet-Dry Vacuum](https://goto.walmart.com/c/1442537/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDyson-V15s-Detect-Submarine-Absolute-Wet-Dry-Vacuum-Cleaner-Gold-New%2F5312261954&subId1=011222bestcordlessstickvacuum)\n\nBest cordless stick vacuum\n\nOur tester loved the Dyson V15s Detect Submarine Absolute's strong suction power and its array of handy attachments. It's versatile as both a vacuum and a mop, and it has a built-in HEPA filtration system that helps keep the air clean and minimize allergy symptoms.\n\n[Read our review](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-dyson-vacuums)\n\n[Bissell IconPet Turbo Edge Vacuum Cleaner](https://r.bttn.io/?btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBissell-ICONPet-Powerful-Motorized-TurboBrush%2Fdp%2FB09M93CZYG%3Fth%3D1%26linkCode%3Dll1%26tag%3D011222bestcordlessstickvacuum-20%26linkId%3D5da1676a5aef4887a002757e4b8c80e0%26language%3Den_US%26ref_%3Das_li_ss_tl&btn_ref=org-510f6485e538e881)\n\nBest budget cordless stick vacuum\n\nThe Bissell 3177A IconPet Turbo Edge is great for cleaning low-pile carpets and throw rugs. Our tester liked its swivel head, saying it makes it easy to reach under furniture and into tight corners. It is also great at vacuuming up dog hair and never clogs. Its dustbin is also easy to empty and we like its battery strength display indicator in the handle.\n\n[Black+Decker PowerSeries Extreme Max Cordless Stick Vacuum](https://r.bttn.io/?btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBLACK-DECKER-POWERSERIES-Cordless-BHFEB520D1%2Fdp%2FB0BW1CH8RV%3F%26linkCode%3Dll1%26tag%3D011222bestcordlessstickvacuum-20%26linkId%3D1d13cdc990164bc6cc1fdc05ac0d277c%26language%3Den_US%26ref_%3Das_li_ss_tl&btn_ref=org-510f6485e538e881)\n\nBest cordless stick vacuum for small spaces\n\nThe Black+Decker PowerSeries Extreme Max cordless stick vacuum works incredibly well in smaller spaces. Its strong suction easily picks up debris, crumbs and hair, and its three attachments are versatile enough to clean tile, wood flooring, carpet and rugs. Plus, it offers 30 minutes of cleaning on its highest power setting with a fully charged battery.\n\nTesting and updates writer [Michelle Rae Uy](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/about/michelle-rae-uy) refers to the Dyson V15s Detect Submarine Absolute Wet-Dry Vacuum as the brand\u2019s full-service vacuum system, as it helped her tackle a range of cleaning needs during her tests. While this vacuum is expensive, we\u2019re still comfortable calling it our best cordless stick vacuum because it offers great value and is worth every penny.\n\nThe Dyson V15s Detect Submarine Absolute has more tools and accessories than the \u201cstandard\u201d version, and it\u2019s a versatile cleaning tool, thanks to those attachments. For instance, its hair screw tool kept Uy\u2019s bed, couch and velvet barstools clean and pet hair-free, which is hard to do in her house full of cats.\n\nIts combination tool and the Dyson-coined Fluffy Optic cleaner head controls dust and dander incredibly well, keeping Uy\u2019s furniture, appliances and floors clean (even during the January 2025 Los Angeles wildfires). And its wet roller head, which is where the \u201cSubmarine\u201d in the vacuum\u2019s name comes from, mops up cat vomit, spills and older stains with ease; however, it wasn\u2019t as effective as the [Dyson WashG1](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=87732X1565017&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.com%2Fwet-cleaning%2Fwashg1%2Fblack-blue&xcust=011222bestcordlessstickvacuum%7Cxid:fr1741960569169ajh) in her side-by-side tests.\n\nOne design detail Uy loved about the V15s Detect Submarine Absolute is that its dusting and crevice tool fits inside the main wand, which is brilliantly handy. You can easily slide off the main wand to reveal the crevice tool, saving time and effort when you need to quickly clean corners, small spaces and hard-to-reach places. This is a much-appreciated convenience that many cordless vacuums don\u2019t offer.\n\nShe also appreciated this model\u2019s impressively powerful motor, which delivers suction power that none of the other Dyson models can match, including the [Dyson V12 Detect Slim](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=87732X1565017&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.com%2Fvacuum-cleaners%2Fcordless%2Fv12%2Fdetect-slim-yellow&xcust=011222bestcordlessstickvacuum%7Cxid:fr1741960569169chd), which is powerful in its own right. The V15s Detect Submarine Absolute effectively sucks up fine baby formula, pet hair and even loose litter.\n\nIts battery life is sufficient, lasting about 30 minutes of vacuuming during testing. The battery is removable, so you [can buy an additional one](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=87732X1565017&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.com%2Fsupport%2Fjourney%2Ftools%2F970938-01&xcust=011222bestcordlessstickvacuum%7Cxid:fr1741960569169gci) for an extra half hour of juice. You can also choose the [Dyson Gen5Outsize Absolute,](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=87732X1565017&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.com%2Fvacuum-cleaners%2Fcordless%2Fgen5%2Foutsize-hepa-absolute-prussian-blue&xcust=011222bestcordlessstickvacuum%7Cxid:fr1741960569169def) which offers 140 minutes of runtime and costs $100 more.\n\nThe only thing Uy didn\u2019t like about the V15s Detect Submarine Absolute is its weight. Although it doesn\u2019t take up as much space, even with all its accessories, it\u2019s heavier than the V12 and the [Dyson V8](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=87732X1565017&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.com%2Fvacuum-cleaners%2Fcordless%2Fv8%2Fsilver-nickel&xcust=011222bestcordlessstickvacuum%7Cxid:fr1741960569169adh).\n\nThe Bissell 3177A IconPet Turbo Edge is ideal for cleaning low-pile carpets and throw rugs. Testing editor [Suzanne Kattau](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/about/suzanne-kattau) brought it to a college dorm move-out (the ultimate test), where she easily vacuumed all the dirt and debris from an area rug and the low-pile dorm room carpet. When comparing the [Dyson to the Bissell](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/dyson-v12-vs-bissell-icon-pet), the Bissell is a quality budget option that does an adequate job at a far lower price.\n\nThe swivel head makes it easy to reach under furniture, and it even features a bright light that illuminates the vacuum path. It comes standard, as do several useful attachments, including a bendable hose and brushes that allowed Kattau to clean a dog bed thoroughly with only a few passes.\n\nIt never clogs either, even after sucking up piles of dog hair from a Pembroke Welsh corgi that sheds tremendously.\n\nIt also easily converts to a handheld vacuum and is lightweight and powerful enough to clean the wood floor of a set of stairs in one pass.\n\nIts dustbin is also easy to clean. All Kattau needed to do was lift the outer portion off the rest of the vacuum and shake the contents into the trash. She occasionally used her fingers to gently pull some tangled dog hair out of the bin, but dirt and debris usually came out on their own.\n\nIt also features a battery-strength indicator in its handle, making it easy to see how much juice is left before it runs out. It takes roughly four hours to charge from empty, but it lasts 30 minutes on its highest setting.\n\nWhile not as powerful as the Dyson V11 Animal and Dyson Gen5detect (and at 10.8 pounds, a little heavier), the Black+Decker PowerSeries Extreme Max cordless stick vacuum works wonderfully in smaller spaces. The suction is strong enough to pick up everything from debris to crumbs to hair (so much hair!), even from hard-to-reach places, and the fully charged battery lasts around 30 minutes on full power, even longer on the Low power setting. Granted, this isn\u2019t on par with the Dyson V11 Animal\u2019s run time, but this is what makes the Black+Decker a perfect apartment vacuum.\n\nWith three attachments, the Black+Decker PowerSeries Extreme Max easily goes from tiles to wooden floors to carpets and rugs without any hassle. It did struggle a little on a shaggy, high-pile rug, though. Thankfully, the motorized rug attachment helps this along, and it continuously impressed CNN Underscored managing editor, [Rachel Quigley](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/about/rachel-quigley), with how much dust and dirt the attachment picks up from the shaggy rug that she always thinks is relatively clean.\n\nWhat Quigley loved most about the Black+Decker PowerSeries Extreme Max is how easy it is to clean every nook and cranny of every room \u2014 even under furniture \u2014 due to its swivel head and ability to lie flat and still pick up dirt with the same suction power. The LED lights are a nice touch, which makes it easy to see into dark corners (though, again, this doesn\u2019t come close to the Dyson V11 Animal\u2019s illumination technology). The Black+Decker PowerSeries Extreme Max model also converts to a handheld version, which is perfect for stairs, cars, car seats and dog beds.\n\nAnother reason the Black+Decker PowerSeries Extreme Max is our pick as the best cordless stick vacuum for smaller spaces is that the vacuum\u2019s anti-tangle beater bar is designed to reduce hair wrap and is removable for easy cleaning. After two months of regular use in an apartment with plenty of hair and fur, the beater bar is still relatively hair-free and doesn\u2019t need to be cleaned.\n\nThe Black+Decker PowerSeries Extreme Max also boasts a cyclonic filtration system. Admittedly, Quigley had to ask the brand why this was an essential or even necessary feature on a vacuum. According to Black+Decker, a cyclone filter separates dirt particles and objects from fine dust, reducing the load on the filter and allowing you to clean and replace it less frequently. This, in turn, enables the vacuum to perform better and last longer. This is hard to evaluate, but it is a good addition based on its intended purpose.\n\nOther features Quigley liked are the noise level (or lack thereof), as it is quiet enough not to disturb anyone, even when vacuuming very early in the morning (as is her preferred time of day to do this chore). It can also stand freely without a wall mount, although it does come with one.\n\nAs for what she didn\u2019t like about this vacuum, the battery takes quite a long time to charge. It takes over three hours to charge fully, and some online reviews claim it can take even longer. The dustbin is a little smaller than the others we tested, so it needs more frequent emptying, but she honestly didn\u2019t mind due to the ease of doing so. You cannot beat the Black+Decker PowerSeries Extreme Max as a reliable and powerful stick vacuum perfect for smaller spaces.\n\nAfter scouring online user and professional reviews and product specifications, our team of testers chose 14 stick vacuums to evaluate. They rated each model on setup, maneuverability, dustbin size and overall performance, considering things like suction power, effectiveness on various floor types and battery life.\n\n\u2022\n\n**Delivery and setup: **Each vacuum arrived in some degree of disassembly, so we lightly factored the setup process into our ratings. Because this is something you only have to do once, we didn\u2019t weigh it too heavily, but we did consider whether any of the models were especially difficult to put together.\n\n\u2022\n\n**Ease of use/maneuverability: **One of the benefits of a stick vacuum over an upright is its greater convenience, so we asked ourselves how effortless it was to use the vacuum in different areas of the house. We considered how well each vacuum swiveled and moved, how much it weighed and whether the design allowed it to reach under furniture and into tighter spaces. They also considered whether the vacuum glided smoothly over carpets and hard floors or if it got stuck or pulled.\n\n\u2022\n\n**Dustbin size: **The size of the dustbin determines how often you have to stop and empty the vacuum canister. Smaller dustbins can fill up quickly, especially for those who own many pets, so we factored this into our testing too.\n\n\u2022\n\n**Ease of emptying: **In addition to the size of the dustbin, we considered how easy (or difficult) it was to empty the canister. Was the process automatic, or did it require us to get our hands a little dirty? The answers helped narrow down the top picks.\n\n\u2022\n\n**Suction power: **Suction power was one of the most important factors in our ratings. We tested the main brush head and each attachment on pet fur, cat litter, pine needles and the regular daily dirt and debris that can get dragged into the house. We noted the suction power when the dustbin was empty versus full and if a full dustbin negatively impacted the suction power. We also paid attention to battery life and noted whether suction power started to diminish as the battery drained.\n\n\u2022\n\n**Effectiveness on different floor types: **We evaluated each stick vacuum on four kinds of floors \u2014 carpet/rug, tile, vinyl and hardwood \u2014 using pet fur, cat litter and pine needles, and took note of the performance as well as maneuverability.\n\n\u2022\n\n**Effectiveness on different pile heights: **In addition to testing on different types of floors, we tested each vacuum on high-pile (very plush) carpet, a medium-pile area rug and a low-pile area rug.\n\n\u2022\n\n**Effectiveness on various surfaces: **Since all the vacuums came with targeted attachments aimed at vacuuming different surfaces, such as stairs and upholstery, we tested how well each worked and how convenient it was to use. We vacuumed couches, cat towers, car seats and a mattress.\n\n\u2022\n\n**Battery life: **One major perk of stick vacuums is that they operate on a battery, so you\u2019re not tethered to the wall by an electrical cord. We timed how long each battery lasted on different power modes between charges and factored this into our results.\n\nThere are four main things to consider when shopping for a cordless stick vacuum: battery life, suction power and effectiveness, ease of use and dustbin size. Here\u2019s why each of these features is important to keep in mind when choosing which model is best for you.\n\nSince a cordless stick vacuum is, well, cordless, the amount of battery life it offers is an incredibly vital consideration, especially for those with larger homes. It can be frustrating to start vacuuming one section of your home only to have to stick the vacuum back on its charger 20 minutes later and sit twiddling your thumbs as it recharges.\n\nBecause of that, folks with a big home should opt for a cordless vacuum that either offers ample battery life (something like 40 minutes or more) or comes with an extra battery. This ensures that you\u2019re able to clean your entire home in one go rather than splitting it into two different chores.\n\nEven if you live in a small apartment, battery life is still an important feature, mainly because you may not need a 40-minute-plus battery (which often costs more). You also won\u2019t need an extra battery (which *also* costs more).\n\nSuction power and effectiveness\n\nAny vacuum, be it a cordless stick vacuum, an [upright vacuum](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-upright-vacuum-cleaner), a [handheld vacuum](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-handheld-vacuum) or even a [robot vacuum](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-robot-vacuum), is worthless if it doesn\u2019t offer adequate suction power. So this should be one of the most significant considerations when shopping.\n\nThere are a few different ways to find a vacuum\u2019s suction power. The first is via its Air Watt (AW) rating. Put plainly, the higher a vacuum\u2019s AW rating, the better suction power it will have. This is the most complete rating, but not all vacuum listings will have this number readily available. You may need to search a model\u2019s online user manual or go directly to the brand site to find it.\n\nThe second is what\u2019s called Water Lift, which refers to how high a vacuum can suck a column of water (this rating isn\u2019t just for robot mops too).\n\nThe final way to view a vacuum\u2019s suction power is via its Airflow rating. The Airflow rating judges how much air a vacuum moves. This rating is most important for larger vacuums intended for cleaning larger surface areas, but it is still a viable key indicator of suction power.\n\nIf a cordless stick vacuum is awkward or clunky to use, you may not be inclined to want to use it all that often (and this defeats the entire purpose of even owning a vacuum). Look for vacuums with swiveling, easy-to-manage vacuum heads and a stick that easily rotates or pivots. This will make it effortless to get to hard-to-reach areas like underneath coffee tables or chairs, between cabinets or under the bed. Also, pay attention to the vacuum\u2019s weight, as some can be surprisingly hefty, making it harder to manage, especially during a longer clean.\n\nLike a vacuum with poor battery life, one with a small dustbin will make cleaning and vacuuming your home a tedious chore. Although some of the best vacuums have small dustbins, our team still recommends opting for a model with a larger one, especially for those with large homes or apartments to clean. Having to run back and forth to the trash can to empty a dustbin can be annoying.\n\n[Tineco Pure One Station 5 Cordless Smart Vacuum](https://r.bttn.io/?btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D8J2RPV9%3F%26linkCode%3Dll1%26tag%3D011222bestcordlessstickvacuum-20%26linkId%3D148a8df185532388600e2175fa90a833%26language%3Den_US%26ref_%3Das_li_ss_tl&btn_ref=org-510f6485e538e881)\n\nOur testers loved the self-cleaning charging dock on the Tineco Pure One Station 5 Cordless Smart Vacuum. The vacuum itself is a lightweight, powerful, bagless model with a long run time and useful features like a green LED headlight that lights up as you go.\n\n[Read our review](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/tineco-pure-one-station-5-cordless-smart-vacuum)\n\nOne of the greatest things about the Tineco Pure One Station 5 Cordless Smart Vacuum is its 3-in-1 self-emptying charging dock that provides a place to store the vacuum in an upright position and, once there, a place to recharge it. Best of all, after you finish vacuuming, the Smart Station also quickly and automatically sucks all the dirt and debris out of the stick\u2019s dustbin into a 2.5-liter chamber. All you need to do is put the vacuum onto the clean station, then press down firmly to recycle efficiently.\n\nThe Pure One Station 5\u2019s regular head has a white toggle conveniently located on top that lets you easily switch it back and forth depending on what size mess you need to vacuum. The head also features a green LED light that shines a 120-degree path as you use it.\n\nThe Pure One Station 5 has what Tineco calls an \u201ciLoop Smart Sensor\u201d that automatically detects dust and debris levels and adjusts the vacuum\u2019s suction power accordingly. The more the debris, the more the suction. As the debris is sucked up, the sensor adjusts and lowers the suction level.\n\nThe Bissell IconPet ultimately performed better and has a similar price tag, so it took the title of best budget cordless stick vacuum.\n\n[Dyson V11 Animal Cordless Vacuum Cleaner](https://r.bttn.io/?btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07NXJDBL8%3FreturnFromLogin%3D1%26linkCode%3Dll1%26tag%3D011222bestcordlessstickvacuum-20%26linkId%3D117a019d829b58a2db6f4ce1e9d59c08%26language%3Den_US%26ref_%3Das_li_ss_tl%26th%3D1&btn_ref=org-510f6485e538e881)\n\nOne of the best features of the Dyson V11 Animal is its lightweight body and swivel head, both of which make this Dyson model easy to maneuver. Its powerful motor easily handles both high- and low-pile carpets and hard flooring. Formerly the pick for best cordless stick vacuum, this Dyson model is edged out in our team's latest round of testing by its newest sibling, the Dyson V15s Detect Submarine Absolute.\n\nThe former pick for best cordless stick vacuum, the Dyson V11 Animal, is a powerhouse that cleans high- and low-pile area rugs and carpets equally well, along with hard floors like vinyl, tile and hardwood. Weighing in at 6.68 pounds, its lightweight, maneuverable body features a swivel head that makes it easy to move around the room. Our testers particularly like how its swivel head cleaned up copious amounts of animal fur, dirt and dust on area rugs and carpets with no problem.\n\nThe Dyson V11 Animal has three modes \u2014 Boost, Auto and Eco \u2014 that are easy to cycle through via a button on the LED screen. The vacuum defaults to Auto mode, which is powerful enough, but whenever you engage Boost mode, the extra power helps pull heavier debris, such as cat litter, out of plush carpet.\n\nThe screen has a battery monitor that gives a rough estimate of the battery life. On paper, the Dyson V11 Animal should offer 60 minutes of continuous run time on a full charge. In reality, the usage drops down to around 30 or 45 minutes when you use Auto or Boost mode, the latter of which sucks up the most juice. The 0.2-gallon (0.76-liter) dustbin is generously sized, and though it makes the Dyson V11 Animal somewhat bulky, our testers said they\u2019d gladly take a bit of bulk in exchange for having to empty it fewer times.\n\nThe Dyson V11 Animal features a high-torque cleaning head and has four additional helpful attachments: a combination tool, dirt brush, crevice tool and mini motorized tool. You can also use the Dyson V11 as a handheld vacuum by removing the main brush head and wand. Though a bit bulky and heavy, using it as a handheld is convenient for vacuuming couches, cat towers and our car.\n\nThere are only two minor quibbles about the Dyson V11 Animal. The first is that you have to continuously hold down the power button while vacuuming, as the button operates on a trigger mechanism. The second is that it doesn\u2019t stand by itself.\n\n[Dyson V12 Detect Slim Cordless Vacuum](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=87732X1565017&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.com%2Fvacuum-cleaners%2Fcordless%2Fv12%2Fdetect-slim-yellow&xcust=011222bestcordlessstickvacuum)\n\nDyson's V12 is a great multisurface stick vacuum that offers plenty of power, solid maneuverability and an easy-to-clean dustbin. However, it takes a long time to charge and, like most Dyson products, it's expensive.\n\nThe Dyson V12 Detect Slim Cordless Stick Vacuum does an outstanding job picking up mounds of dog hair from two dog beds, wood flooring, a dirty outside welcome mat and low-pile hallway and bedroom carpet. It\u2019s a powerful, lightweight vacuum with great maneuverability, featuring a head that turns left and right to easily access corners and tight spots.\n\nIt takes around three and a half hours to charge from an empty battery to fully charged, but our testers said they got roughly 30 minutes of use on its highest power setting. There\u2019s also a turbo strength setting that\u2019s quite powerful but runs the battery out after about 20 minutes of carpet and rug cleaning.\n\nThe V12 also has HEPA filtration and sports a digital display at the top of the unit to alert you of battery strength and other helpful information, such as the current power level and when to unclog a clogged dustbin. Although it is powerful enough to suck up loads of pet hair, it does clog occasionally, and you have to clean the dustbin manually.\n\nWhile cleaning a dustbin is never fun, the V12\u2019s is easy to clean; all you have to do is lift its red handle, and the dustbin door opens up, dumping all its contents into the trash. Though this Dyson is impressive, the V15s Detect was the superior model in testing, winning the top overall spot.\n\n[Dyson Gen5detect Cordless Vacuum Cleaner](https://r.bttn.io/?btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDyson-Gen5detect-Cordless-Vacuum-Cleaner%2Fdp%2FB0C2JD5H7D%3Fth%3D1%26linkCode%3Dll1%26tag%3D011222bestcordlessstickvacuum-20%26linkId%3D226d834911b05cbe4e2f1c8a69bd80e4%26language%3Den_US%26ref_%3Das_li_ss_tl&btn_ref=org-510f6485e538e881)\n\nAs one of the latest in Dyson\u2019s cordless stick vacuum lineup, the Dyson Gen5detect covers the expected bases for a Dyson vacuum. It\u2019s impeccably designed, easy to use and powerful enough for routine or deep house cleanings.\n\n[Read our review](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/dyson-gen5detect)\n\nThe Dyson Gen5detect could work as the primary vacuum in your home, as long as you don\u2019t mind spending upwards of $950 on a vacuum.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect for the price, it does have excellent usability, thanks to Dyson\u2019s sharp design touches. At 7.7 pounds, the Dyson Gen5detect is slightly heavier than the competition; comparable models like the Samsung Bespoke Jet AI clock in at around 6 pounds.\n\nThe Dyson Gen5detect carries over some of the great features from recent Dyson vacuums like the Fluffy Optic hard surface attachment, which has an angled green light that illuminates floor dust, and a 0.2-gallon bin with a convenient no-contact emptying latch. But it also comes with several new upgrades, such as an integrated crevice-and-dusting tool, which is built into its wand section. If you\u2019re cleaning multiple areas during a cleaning session, you don\u2019t have to awkwardly switch between additional attachments to dust shelves or clean between furniture.\n\nThe Dyson Gen5detect\u2019s auto-power system is also another impressive feature. This system automatically adjusts the Dyson\u2019s suction power based on the size and amount of dirt it picks up. It quickly revs up when moving from a hardwood floor to a living room rug, and its power system also distinguishes between surface-level dust and larger dust bunnies.\n\nFor as good as the Dyson Gen5detect\u2019s performance is, this cordless vacuum\u2019s high price tag will likely give some potential shoppers pause.\n\n[Dyson Gen5outsize Cordless Vacuum Cleaner](https://r.bttn.io/?btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDyson-Gen5outsize-Cordless-Vacuum-Cleaner%2Fdp%2FB0C2JBDYKZ%3Fcrid%3D1X8MK9WXTBU01%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.l2PGHRSdHBUkjI-CQ7JGJcTSNnlGO-EZw-k5HrR-oJyF9-zVZMV5SOpEzQIzB9-VaNjugWRHmsT_f7t0kSoYzvOsi4reCDDGKwvyvmvibNnT7WGgjVN8DAOEs0LJpFdhpTCJFYy0bt1Fr1Af5_D2QRQ8ozWRj6uBTiq6Tj5XD0GbNcfRWlHBWd9SNmZoJ4_vUu6jlbB2Jh2raERX55wbOP3kfgG-XHCUGQsXRJ7ksNE.itxCgMi2bAPf45uIxrkXurn_ZeXTz-iugIxvJufIeKE%26dib_tag%3D011222bestcordlessstickvacuum%26keywords%3Ddyson%252Bgen5outsize%26qid%3D1736784900%26sprefix%3Ddyson%252Bgen5outsiz%252Caps%252C118%26sr%3D8-1%26th%3D1%26linkCode%3Dll1%26tag%3D011222bestcordlessstickvacuum-20%26linkId%3D96e0308ef9f305de936350e749a6f4c3%26language%3Den_US%26ref_%3Das_li_ss_tl&btn_ref=org-510f6485e538e881)\n\nFrom the inside and outside, the Dyson Gen5outsize is essentially an upgraded version of the Dyson Gen5detect. For a bit more money, you get a larger 0.5-gallon bin, a 12-inch multisurface cleaning head and a second battery pack.\n\nAs with other high-end Dysons, the Gen5outsize\u2019s design is stellar and emphasizes usability. The cordless vacuum\u2019s attachments handle excellently, and the Gen5outsize replaces Dyson\u2019s traditional power trigger with a simple power button that keeps the vacuum running. Our testers loved the Dyson Gen5outsize\u2019s hard floor attachment, which comes with a green light that illuminates dust and gives you an additional layer of cleaning precision.\n\nThey also liked its dirt sensor system, which automatically adjusts the suction power depending on the amount of dirt it needs to picks up. The Dyson Gen5outsize quickly adjusts between a medium-pile rug, hardwood living room and kitchen floor without missing a beat as well.\n\nHowever, the extra horsepower and bin capacity have a slight downside. At 8.6 pounds, it\u2019s notably heavier than comparable cordless stick vacuums, which typically clock in at around 5 to 6 pounds. The Dyson\u2019s extra weight is slightly alleviated when you attach the extension wand and do floor cleaning, but in handheld mode, your arms may start to fatigue after using it for more than a few minutes.\n\nWhile it gives off more of an upright vacuum than a stick vacuum vibe, the Hoover Onepwr Evolve Pet is cordless and works well on all types of flooring, though it struggles a little bit on really plush carpet.\n\nThere are three settings \u2014 carpet, hard floor and no brush roll \u2014 that you can toggle through manually, and each does a decent job of sucking up all types of debris off various floor types, although high-pile carpet took a few passes. The Hoover Onepwr Pet is a good choice for smaller living areas or homes that only have low-pile rugs or hard floors.\n\n**Editor\u2019s Note:** *We previously tested the Eufy Mach V1 Ultra, the Dyson Omni-Glide, the Bissell SpinWave + Vac All-in-One Cordless Mop and Vacuum, the Samsung Bespoke Jet AI Cordless Stick Vacuum* *and the Miele Triflex HX1 Cat and Dog, but they are no longer available and may have been discontinued.

This can fill up quickly, though, so it\u2019s important to empty the canister\u2019s contents into a [trash can](https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-kitchen-trash-cans) after each use.\n\nCNN Underscored thoroughly tests the products in our testing guides and provides full transparency about how we test them.

    "title": "NASA is about to send people to the moon \u2014 in a spacecraft not everyone thinks is safe to fly | CNN",
    "excerpt": "As the four-person crew of Artemis II prepares to launch on a historic mission around the moon as soon as February, some experts are worried about the Orion spacecraft\u2019s heat shield.",
    "content": "When four astronauts begin a historic trip around the moon as soon as February 6, they\u2019ll climb aboard NASA\u2019s 16.5-foot-wide Orion spacecraft with the understanding that it has a known flaw \u2014 one that has some experts urging the space agency not to fly the mission with humans on board. But NASA remains confident it has a handle on the problem and the vehicle can bring the crew home safely.\n\nThe issue relates to a special coating applied to the bottom part** **of the spacecraft, called the heat shield. It\u2019s a crucial piece of hardware designed to protect the astronauts from extreme temperatures as they\u2019re descending back to Earth during the final stretch of their [moon-bound mission called Artemis II](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/17/science/nasa-artemis-ii-moon-mission).\n\nThis vital part of the Orion spacecraft is nearly identical to the heat shield flown on [Artemis I](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/11/world/artemis-1-mission-explainer/), an uncrewed 2022 test flight. That prior mission\u2019s Orion vehicle returned from space with a heat shield pockmarked by unexpected damage \u2014 prompting NASA to investigate the issue.\n\nAnd while NASA is poised to clear the heat shield for flight, even those who believe the mission is safe acknowledge there is unknown risk involved.\n\n\u201cThis is a deviant heat shield,\u201d said Dr. Danny Olivas, a former NASA astronaut who served on a space agency-appointed independent review team that [investigated](https://www.calameo.com/read/00270123481c7e3a8c300) the incident. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it: This is not the heat shield that NASA would want to give its astronauts.\u201d\n\nStill, Olivas said he believes after spending years analyzing what went wrong with the heat shield, NASA \u201chas its arms around the problem.\u201d\n\nUpon [completing](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/nasa-identifies-cause-of-artemis-i-orion-heat-shield-char-loss/) the investigation about a year ago, NASA determined it would fly the Artemis II Orion capsule as is, believing it could ensure the crew\u2019s safety by slightly altering the mission\u2019s flight path.\n\nIn a statement to CNN on Friday, NASA said the agency \u201cconsidered all aspects\u201d when making that decision, noting there is also \u201cuncertainty that comes with the development and qualification of the processes of changing the manufacturing process of the Avcoat ablator blocks.\u201d\n\nBasically, NASA said, there\u2019s uncertainty involved no matter which course of action it takes.\n\n\u201cI think in my mind, there\u2019s no flight that ever takes off where you don\u2019t have a lingering doubt,\u201d Olivas said. \u201cBut NASA really does understand what they have. They know the importance of the heat shield to crew safety, and I do believe that they\u2019ve done the job.\u201d\n\nLakiesha Hawkins, the acting deputy associate administrator for NASA\u2019s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, echoed that sentiment in [September,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFvHUa4_VOU) saying, \u201cfrom a risk perspective, we feel very confident.\u201d\n\nAnd Reid Wiseman, the astronaut set to command the Artemis II mission, has expressed his confidence.\n\n\u201cThe investigators discovered the root cause, which was the key\u201d to understanding and solving the heat shield issue, Wiseman [told reporters last July](https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/artemis-ii-crew-expresses-confidence-in-orion-capsule-heat-shield/). \u201cIf we stick to the new reentry path that NASA has planned, then this heat shield will be safe to fly.\u201d\n\nOthers aren\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re talking about doing is crazy,\u201d said Dr. Charlie Camarda, a heat shield expert, research scientist and former NASA astronaut.\n\nCamarda \u2014 who was also a member of the first space shuttle crew to launch after the 2003 Columbia disaster \u2014 is among a group of former NASA employees who do not believe that the space agency should put astronauts on board the upcoming lunar excursion. He said he has spent months trying to get agency leadership to heed his warnings to no avail.\n\n\u201cWe could have solved this problem way back when,\u201d Camarda, who worked as a NASA research scientist for two decades before becoming an astronaut, said of the heat shield issue. \u201cInstead, they keep kicking the can down the road.\u201d\n\nNow, the agency appears on track to green-light Artemis II for takeoff, as its leaders have sought to assure the public \u2014 and the crew \u2014 the mission will be safe.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft was rolled to its launchpad atop the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket on January 17. And a crucial milestone could be days away as Artemis program leaders gather for final risk assessments and the flight readiness review, a meeting in which top brass will determine whether the Artemis II rocket and spacecraft are ready to take off with NASA\u2019s Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and the Canadian Space Agency\u2019s Jeremy Hansen, on board.\n\nEven before Artemis, the Orion capsule \u2014 a [$20.4 billion spacecraft](https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/cost-of-sls-and-orion) that NASA spent 20 years developing \u2014 was not exactly a darling of the aerospace community. Resentment for the vehicle has been brewing in various pockets of the industry for some time.\n\nOne engineer and physicist who previously worked on advanced technology development but did not work directly on the Artemis program derided Orion as \u201c[flaming garbage.](https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2025/10/31/nasas-orion-space-capsule-is-flaming-garbage/)\u201d A former employee at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, he decried the capsule\u2019s exceptionally long development timeline and cost overruns that have ballooned into the billions of dollars.\n\nLori Garver, a former deputy administrator for NASA under the Obama administration, has [publicly lamented](https://x.com/Lori_Garver/status/1985147604121092154) the politicking that colored the vehicle\u2019s path to completion.\n\nBut Orion\u2019s issues can\u2019t be fully pinned on politics, said Dr. Ed Pope, a heat shield and material science expert who founded Matech, a California-based missile defense technology company. Pope did not participate in NASA\u2019s heat shield investigation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a Republican thing or a Democrat thing at all,\u201d Pope told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a bureaucrat thing.\u201d\n\nThe decisions that led up to the heat shield issues NASA is grappling with today began early in the spacecraft\u2019s development process, according to Pope.\n\nOrion program managers chose to make the spacecraft\u2019s heat shield out of Avcoat material in 2009. The heat shields manufactured for NASA\u2019s Apollo capsules all had a protective Avcoat layer, so leaders viewed it as a well-understood material with decades of data to back up its effectiveness.\n\nFor an uncrewed test flight in 2014, called EFT-1, the mission team outfitted an Orion capsule with a heat shield applied in the same manner as in the Apollo era \u2014 in an intricate honeycomb-like structure.\n\nBut that approach required a tedious manufacturing process that NASA hoped to avoid.\n\n\u201cIt was very finicky, and it was going to be really, really hard to reproduce that quickly,\u201d said Pam Melroy, a longtime NASA employee, former astronaut and Air Force officer who once served as deputy administrator of the space agency. \u201cThat was part of the reason why we said, \u2018Let\u2019s just make this a simpler design.\u2019 It was really all about producibility.\u201d\n\nEven before the EFT-1 test flight launched, NASA program managers wanted to alter the design, according to Melroy. Though NASA said in a statement the final decision was made in 2015.\n\nNASA also said the honeycomb-structured Avcoat experienced issues during manufacturing for EFT-1, noting \u201ccracks in seams appeared between the different honeycomb sections\u201d and the material did not cure evenly and was weaker than expected. That made it \u201cmarginally acceptable\u201d for the 2014 test flight and likely unusable for a lunar mission that requires far faster speeds and a more violent reentry process.\n\nTextron Systems, the Texas-based company that produces Avcoat, told CNN in a statement that in 2015 it \u201clicensed the Avcoat material to Lockheed Martin, who is contracted by NASA to manufacture the heat shields for the Artemis program\u201d and deferred further comment to the aerospace giant.\n\nBlaine Brown, director of Orion Spacecraft Mechanical Systems at Lockheed Martin Space, confirmed in a statement to CNN that the Avcoat structure was altered \u201cto increase manufacturing and installation efficiency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe support NASA\u2019s decision to fly the Artemis II mission with its current heat shield and are committed to seeing Orion safely launch and return on its historic mission to the Moon with crew onboard,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThe Orion capsules built for the Artemis missions abandoned the Avcoat honeycomb structure in favor of a heat shield constructed using large blocks of the material.\n\n\u201cOur experience with a block design on Mars heat shields showed us that blocks were easier to produce, test and install,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThe first real-world test of the new Orion heat shield design, however, came with the Artemis I test flight in 2022. After that mission, NASA found chunks of the heat shield had broken off, leaving divots in the charred Avcoat material.\n\nThat is not how the heat shield is supposed to behave. The Avcoat layer is meant to erode in a controlled manner as it heats.\n\nNASA disclosed the problem months after Orion returned from space in 2022. The agency\u2019s office of the inspector general then released images of the ravaged Artemis I heat shield in a 2024 [report](https://oig.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ig-24-011.pdf).\n\nFurther complicating the situation was the fact that by that point it was already too late to fix the heat shield for Artemis II.\n\nNASA did not \u2014 and could not \u2014 replace the Artemis II heat shield with a new one. The Orion capsule slated for the mission already had its heat shield installed even before Artemis I flew, and \u201cyou couldn\u2019t just go to Billy Bob\u2019s heat shield removal shop\u201d to replace it, Olivas noted.\n\nThe investigation into the Artemis I heat shield issue also concluded that even though there were no astronauts on board the test flight, \u201cflight data showed that had crew been aboard, they would have been safe.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about NASA\u2019s decision to move forward with the Artemis II mission without replacing the heat shield, Melroy, who oversaw the heat shield investigation as deputy administrator, said that NASA \u201cprogram managers sometimes have to make these trades for cost, schedule and performance, and they certainly didn\u2019t undertake that decision lightly.\u201d\n\nHeat shields produced for future Artemis missions will be manufactured with upgraded techniques, NASA leaders revealed in a December 2024 [news conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr8aGC5PG-I).\n\nSpecifically, the agency plans to alter the \u201cbillet mold loading\u201d essentially altering how much Avcoat is loaded into a mold to ultimately produce a more permeable shield, NASA said in its Friday statement to CNN.\n\nIn the meantime, analysis of what went wrong during the 2022 test flight is informing a new approach for this year\u2019s upcoming mission.\n\nAvcoat is ablative, meaning the material is designed to char and erode in a controlled manner as the spacecraft comes roaring back from the moon and dips back into the thick inner band of Earth\u2019s atmosphere while still traveling more than 30 times the speed of sound.\n\nThis phase of flight, called \u201creentry,\u201d causes a violent compression of air molecules that can heat the spacecraft\u2019s exterior to more than 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius).\n\nNASA engineers designed the Orion spacecraft for a \u201cskip reentry\u201d \u2014 the capsule acts like a flat stone skipping atop the surface of a still lake as it dips briefly into the atmosphere and briefly raises its altitude once more before final descent. The special trajectory allows Orion to target a precise splashdown location.\n\nIn 2024, NASA [twice](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/09/world/nasa-artemis-moon-landing-delay-scn) [opted](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/05/science/nasa-artemis-moon-mission-landing-delays) to delay the timeline for the Artemis II launch in part to allow more time to collect data.\n\nThe problem, NASA concluded after months of research, was that the Avcoat material used in the Artemis I heat shield was not permeable enough. That meant that when the Orion capsule dipped into the atmosphere, gases built up in the heat shield\u2019s interior, causing chunks of the material to break off and cracks to form.\n\nNone of the experts interviewed by CNN dispute this characterization of why the Artemis I heat shield did not perform as expected.\n\nUp for debate is how well NASA\u2019s Artemis mission managers understand the problem and exactly how much risk the suboptimal heat shield poses to the four astronauts slated to launch in a few weeks.\n\nIn September, some of the space agency\u2019s Artemis program leaders said they believed Orion\u2019s heat shield would perform well on Artemis II, despite there being no substantial changes to its design.\n\nIn fact, while NASA now plans to manufacture future heat shields to be permeable, Artemis II\u2019s heat shield is actually less permeable than the one built for Artemis I.\n\nAbout 6% of the Artemis I heat shield\u2019s surface area was permeable, Olivas noted, and that permeable area did not suffer any cracking. But the Artemis II heat shield, he added, does not have any permeable areas, noting that change was made prior to the Artemis I test flight and before NASA realized the heat shield needed to be permeable to perform well.\n\nRick Henfling, the Artemis flight director leading reentry, said during a September news conference that the Artemis II reentry trajectory has been modified with the goal of avoiding the conditions that caused the Artemis I heat shield to crack.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t go as high on that skip, it\u2019ll just be a loft,\u201d Henfling said.\n\nThis new reentry path, Henfling said, should allow the Avcoat material to erode normally.\n\n\u201cWe want to emphasize that safety is our top priority,\u201d Hawkins added, repeating a long-held NASA mantra.\n\nThe decision to use an altered trajectory was made after extensive testing, NASA said in its Friday statement. And the adjusted return path is designed to create \u201ca steeper descent angle to reduce exposure time at peak heating, thus minimizing further char loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis thorough testing, analysis, simulation, and expert validation collectively formed NASA\u2019s official flight rationale providing sufficient justification to proceed without redesigning the heat shield,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nOther experts, however, disagree that changing Orion\u2019s flight path is enough to guarantee that the crew will make it home safely.\n\n\u201cThe reason this is such a big deal is that when the heat shield is spalling \u2014 or you have big chunks coming off \u2014 even if the vehicle isn\u2019t destroyed, you\u2019re right at the point of incipient failure now,\u201d said Dr. Dan Rasky, an expert on advanced entry systems and thermal protection materials who worked at NASA for more than 30 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re at the edge of the cliff on a foggy day,\u201d Rasky said.\n\nRasky, like Camarda, does not believe that NASA should allow astronauts to fly on board the Artemis II Orion capsule.\n\nEven some experts who believe Artemis II is safe to fly acknowledge that the Orion heat shield will likely crack and display signs of damage upon its return from Earth, even with the modified trajectory.\n\n\u201cWill the heat shield crack? Yes, it\u2019s going to crack,\u201d Olivas, the astronaut who aided NASA\u2019s heat shield investigation, said.\n\nBut Orion has some built-in \u201crobustness,\u201d said Dr. Steve Scotti, a distinguished research associate at NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, who served as a volunteer on an [advisory team](https://www.nasa.gov/nesc/) that was involved in the Artemis I heat shield investigation.\n\nUnderneath the Avcoat layer, Scotti said, lies a composite structure that during testing has been able to briefly survive the extreme temperatures of reentry. And that structure could serve as a last line of defense in the unlikely case that the Avcoat material becomes so deformed it begins to expose the underside of the spacecraft, Scotti said.\n\nThe composite structure wasn\u2019t put there as a fail-safe or backup for the heat shield \u2014 but it\u2019s lucky it is there, Scotti said.\n\nOlivas emphasized that NASA isn\u2019t expecting to rely on the composite structure to keep the astronauts safe. The Avcoat material should still do that, he said. But the structure does provide an extra layer of safety, Olivas noted.\n\nAnd even if the Artemis II heat shield performs worse than it did during Artemis I, Olivas and Scotti are confident the astronauts will remain safe.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any strong fears that the crew is in danger,\u201d Scotti told CNN, echoing Olivas\u2019 sentiments.\n\nBut neither Scotti\u2019s nor Olivas\u2019 expressions of optimism come without an asterisk. Both experts acknowledge, as Camarda argues, that engineers cannot possibly predict exactly how the heat shield will behave.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little data to be able to put into an analysis\u201d of the heat shield, Scotti told CNN. \u201cThe material itself changes every 20 seconds or so during reentry,\u201d he said, referring to the Avcoat layer.\n\n\u201cWe still have things we don\u2019t know,\u201d Scotti added. \u201cIt\u2019s not low risk, it\u2019s a moderate risk.\u201d\n\nScotti\u2019s and Olivas\u2019 votes of confidence in the Artemis II mission were hard won.\n\nOlivas, in fact, held serious doubts about NASA\u2019s intention to fly the Artemis II mission with crew until he sat through a three-hour meeting at the space agency\u2019s headquarters in Washington, DC, on January 8.\n\nCNN requested and was denied access to the meeting. Only two journalists were invited to attend, and the meeting was expected to be largely off the record because confidential information was being discussed.\n\nNASA\u2019s newly installed administrator, Jared Isaacman, convened the meeting to gauge dissenting opinions, he told CNN affiliate station [WESH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW0Kqc0Cmrc) in Orlando.\n\nThe meeting, Isaacman said, \u201conly reaffirmed my confidence in the decisions of the bright engineers at NASA.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have modified our reentry profile. We have regained margin to safety, and I feel very good about that with Artemis II,\u201d he added.\n\nBut Olivas said his hesitations were absolved by a presentation from a \u201cTiger Team\u201d \u2014 a NASA term for a specialized team brought together to solve a complex problem \u2014 at Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\n\u201cThe key parameter here is: When is the heat shield going to crack? And how deep into the atmosphere are you going to be if it does crack?\u201d Olivas said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s things that we can never know until it actually happens,\u201d he added, referring to the heat shield. But the Tiger Team\u2019s analysis gave him confidence that NASA understood the Avcoat material well enough to be certain the crew would not be in danger.\n\n\u201cThe Tiger Team did a phenomenal job,\u201d Olivas said. \u201cI trust those engineers emphatically, and the program managers who are driving them.\u201d\n\nThat, however, is where Camarda \u2014 who also attended the January 8 meeting at NASA headquarters \u2014 disagrees.\n\nCamarda takes issue, for example, with a computer program that the Tiger Team used in its heat shield analysis.\n\nCalled the Crack Indication Tool, or CIT, it was meant to model how and when the Avcoat material might begin fragmenting in various conditions.\n\nWhat if Orion were to take a smaller \u201cskip\u201d before making its final plunge?\n\nThe CIT is meant to churn out data about how such changes might impact the heat shield \u2014 and whether those scenarios would trigger cracking.\n\nBut the data is imperfect, Camarda argues, and the tool relies on \u201csimplifying assumptions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe analysis is a simplistic model to predict gas generation, material charring and qualitatively when cracks happen,\u201d Camarda said. \u201cBut the failure mechanism is how the cracks grow, and it definitely can\u2019t predict that. It cannot predict the stresses and strains that cause the cracks or how they can grow.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Camarda\u2019s criticisms of the CIT, Olivas acknowledged that no computer modeling program is completely accurate. And the CIT cannot predict crack growth.\n\nBut among the data points that assuaged Olivas\u2019 concerns, he said, was the fact that the Tiger Team lined up the computer program\u2019s predictions with real-world lab tests involving Avcoat material. The CIT was also able to correctly predict and re-create the conditions that led to the cracking on Artemis I.\n\n\u201cThat gave me a confidence that the tool itself was indeed a good predictor,\u201d Olivas said.\n\nBut, Camarda counters, it is possible to create modeling tools that take a more interdisciplinary approach.\n\n\u201cA multi-physics analysis can do everything in one computer code,\u201d Camarda said. \u201cIt\u2019s predicting the aero thermodynamic heating on the outside of the vehicle, and studying how the material changes phases and starts to burn and produces gases.\u201d\n\nThat, he said, is the type of analysis that could give program managers a more holistic understanding of the risks this heat shield poses.\n\nTo Camarda, the heat shield problem is one symptom of a widespread ailment plaguing NASA that took root in the shuttle era. His view of the agency is informed by his experience as a young astronaut preparing to fly when the Space Shuttle Columbia broke apart during reentry in 2003, killing all seven passengers.\n\nIt marked the second tragedy for the program after the Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed during ascent in 1986.\n\nIn a phone interview with CNN, Camarda highlighted that in the early 1980s, NASA had estimated that the space shuttle would have a roughly [1 in 100,000](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20190002249/downloads/20190002249.pdf) chance of experiencing a deadly malfunction.\n\nUltimately, however, the shuttle flew a total of 135 missions with two explosions, resulting in 14 total casualties. That put the vehicle\u2019s actual odds of experiencing a catastrophic failure at 1 in 67.5.\n\nAt one point during his NASA career, Camarda was appointed head of engineering at Johnson Space Center only, he said, to be pushed out from that role after vocally expressing concerns about mission safety in the aftermath of the Columbia disaster, he wrote in \u201c[Mission Out of Control](https://www.amazon.com/Mission-Out-Control-Charles-Camarda/dp/1958914509),\u201d a memoir and technical deep dive about his years at the agency.\n\nCamarda\u2019s former boss did not respond to an email request for comment.\n\nCamarda ultimately left NASA in 2019 after 45 years of service.\n\nIn his view, the space agency has shifted away from a research and discovery mindset that it embodied during the Apollo era \u2014 when engineers were encouraged to identify and express concerns about potential safety issues as they picked apart engineering challenges on a fundamental level.\n\nIn today\u2019s climate, Camarda said, he worries NASA employees are encouraged to fall in line with the assessments and goals of the agency\u2019s management and leadership.\n\nEdgar Zapata, a retired Kennedy Space Center engineer who still serves on the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) External Council, a program that aims to fund bleeding-edge technology development, said he shares Camarda\u2019s concerns.\n\n\u201cI think our experiences are shaded by having seen that once this body politic decides, almost by mysterious forces, that it\u2019s going to do something \u2014 it tends to figure out a way to move forward,\u201d Zapata said of NASA\u2019s decision-making process and risk assessments.\n\nNASA spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment about criticisms from Camarda regarding the agency\u2019s culture. NASA has long maintained and emphasized that it considers safety to be its top priority.\n\nCamarda also emphasized that his opposition to Artemis II isn\u2019t driven by a belief it will end with a catastrophic failure. He thinks it\u2019s likely the mission will return home safely.\n\nMore than anything, Camarda told CNN, he fears that a safe flight for Artemis II will serve as validation for NASA leadership that its decision-making processes are sound. And that\u2019s bound to lull the agency into a false sense of security, Camarda warned.\n\nThe two former astronauts and heat shield experts \u2014 Olivas and Camarda \u2014 do not share the same opinion about whether NASA should launch the Artemis II mission with crew on board. But on this point, they agree: \u201cSometimes we get lucky. And when we get lucky, sometimes we trade that for being good \u2014 and then we convince ourselves we\u2019re better than we really are,\u201d Olivas told CNN.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s valid to question what\u2019s happening at NASA,\u201d Olivas added, \u201cbecause our history is not perfect.\u201d\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE:\u00a0 This story has been updated with additional information.",

    "content": "Go ahead, eat chocolate cake every day. One healthy cookbook author gives us permission \u2014 and a recipe that\u2019s protein-packed.\n\nRachel Riggs\u2019 signature unfussy cake asks for just one bowl, a single whisk and 10 minutes to get the oven ready. The result is a chocolate dessert that contains 18 grams of [protein](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/health/how-to-eat-more-protein-diet-wellness) per slice and tastes so amazing that Riggs ate a piece as part of lunch daily for six years straight.\n\nNo wonder she named it The Everyday Chocolate Cake.\n\n\u201cThis is a legit dessert. I think it\u2019s virtually indistinguishable from any mainstream chocolate cake,\u201d said Riggs, who included it in her debut cookbook, \u201c[In Good Health](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Health-Uncomplicated-Allergen-Aware-Nourished/dp/1773272780): Uncomplicated, Allergen-Aware Recipes for a Nourished Life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this cake, the almond flour provides healthy fats, and the pure maple syrup, cocoa powder and unsweetened chocolate deliver antioxidants. Eggs are nutrition powerhouses, too,\u201d Riggs explained.\n\nEach serving of this cake has as much [appetite-taming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031938420304376), [muscle-building](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/1/66/5936522) protein as three large eggs, which is courtesy of the almond flour, eggs and cocoa powder. (The cocoa powder alone adds about [4 grams per \u00bc cup](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/169593/nutrients).\nEach egg tacks on 6 grams, and each cup of almond flour layers on 32 grams more protein.) Keep in mind that it also has 39 grams of sugar per slice (including the ganache), courtesy of the natural sweetener maple syrup, so you can determine how often you\u2019d like to slot this into your diet.\n\nThe inspiration for this cake came from a not-so-sweet place. Riggs has been passionate about food for as long as she can remember.\n\n\u201cCheese is where my deepest passion was, so I opened a specialty food shop in 2006. Within four years, there was a substantial shift in my health, so I was forced to close my shop,\u201d the author recalled.\n\nThe symptoms started off subtly but grew over time to the point that the profound fatigue they triggered resulted in \u201cpunishing payback for hours, days \u2014 or sometimes weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cLike so many people with chronic illness, I went from doctor to doctor, then started broadening my scope and traveling for medical care. It remained a mystery.\u201d\n\nDuring her mission to try anything that might ease the pain and fatigue, Riggs embarked on a doctor-approved, strict elimination diet.\n\n\u201cI went three months without this whole swath of ingredients,\u201d Riggs said. \u201cEventually, I was able to start adding those things in, and that\u2019s how you identify if something isn\u2019t a good fit for your body.\u201d\n\nRiggs discovered she felt better eliminating her original potential triggers, including grains (not just gluten), dairy, refined sugars, legumes, peanuts, shellfish and nightshades (a class of vegetables that includes tomatoes, potatoes, peppers and eggplants). She still finds plenty of different foods to eat, such as meat, fish, seafood, fruits, many nuts, most vegetables, seeds, herbs and spices.\n\nLooking to cook with a limited ingredient list, Riggs found inspiring options lacking and started developing her own recipes \u201cto feed myself and my husband food that didn\u2019t feel punitive,\u201d Riggs said.\n\nThe result was her first cookbook, \u201cIn Good Health.\u201d When pulling together those recipes, the nonnegotiables, she decided, were nourishment, deliciousness and ease.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any adaptations or faux foods here,\u201d Riggs said. Instead, \u201cit\u2019s really just whole, nutrient-dense food. These are the recipes that I\u2019ve been relying on for years.\u201d\n\nYes, berries, sweet potatoes and salmon are on the menu. As is ahi tuna, roasted almonds, rotisserie chicken and more. \u201cEven if somebody doesn\u2019t have their own restrictions, we\u2019re all cooking for people that do these days,\u201d she said. \u201cThis book is a great resource for when you\u2019re cooking for friends or relatives who have dietary restrictions, say, for a holiday, which can be very daunting.\u201d\n\nStart with The Everyday Chocolate Cake** **and soon you\u2019ll be trying Morning Glory Muffins, Zesty Herbed Tahini Dip and Savory French Onion Beef.****\n\nServes 6\n\n**Prep time:** 20 minutes\n\n**Bake time:** 25 minutes\n\n**Cool time:** 20 minutes\n\n**Total cooking time:** 1 hour 5 minutes\n\nOne of Riggs\u2019 most beloved cures for her cravings is this cake, which gets its decadent crumb from the cocoa powder.\n\nShe uses a premium cocoa powder with a higher fat content that gives it a richer flavor. \u201cWhen you\u2019re cooking with so few ingredients, the ingredients matter,\u201d Riggs said. (That\u2019s why she includes her product picks in the cookbook.)\n\nOnce you\u2019ve mastered this version of The Everyday Chocolate Cake, Riggs gives you permission to mix things up. Try adding \u215b teaspoon of mint extract to the ganache for a minty chocolate cookie vibe, she said, or add a drop or two of orange oil instead. Or bake the same batter in a cupcake pan for a single-serving dessert.\n\n\u201cMy book also includes a birthday cake variation on this with a thicker, more spreadable ganache, because nobody should have to celebrate a birthday without a birthday cake,\u201d Riggs told me.\n\n\u2022\n\nVirgin coconut oil, for greasing\n\n\u2022\n\n2 \u00bd cups (260 grams) superfine blanched almond flour\n\n\u2022\n\n\u00bc cup (30 grams) cocoa powder, preferably Valrhona\n\n\u2022\n\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n\n\u2022\n\n\u00be teaspoon Himalayan pink salt\n\n\u2022\n\n\u00be cup (235 grams) pure maple syrup\n\n\u2022\n\n3 large eggs, room temperature\n\n\u2022\n\n\u00bc cup (60 grams) canned full-fat, additive-free coconut milk (see note)\n\n\u2022\n\n2 ounces (57 grams) 100% unsweetened chocolate (see note)\n\n\u2022\n\n2 tablespoons pure maple syrup\n\n\u2022\n\n\u215b teaspoon Himalayan pink salt\n\n\u2022\n\nMake the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Thoroughly grease a 9-inch (23-centimeter) nonstick springform pan with coconut oil and line the bottom with parchment paper.\n\n\u2022\n\nIn a medium mixing bowl, whisk together almond flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt, breaking up any lumps. Add the maple syrup and eggs, and whisk until smooth and combined well. Pour the batter into the springform pan. Using a rubber spatula, spread it toward the edges and tap the pan on the counter to level the batter.\n\n\u2022\n\nBake for 25 minutes on the center rack. Cool for 20 minutes, then transfer the cake to a serving plate.\n\n\u2022\n\nAllow the cake to cool completely before making the ganache.\n\n\u2022\n\nMake the ganache: Combine all ganache ingredients in a small glass or porcelain bowl and microwave for 30 seconds. Using a small whisk, whisk gently for 2 to 3 minutes, until the chocolate is melted, smooth, glossy and slightly thickened but still pourable.\n\n\u2022\n\nPour the chocolate ganache onto the top (center) of the cake. Using an offset spatula or the back of a spoon, carefully spread the ganache over the cake, nudging it gently over the edge and allowing it to drip down the sides as much as you like.\n\n\u2022\n\nRefrigerate the cake, uncovered, for 30 minutes so the ganache can set.\n\n\u2022\n\nCover and store at room temperature for up to three days, or in the fridge for up to a week.\n\n*Note: Look for a baking bar that contains only cacao beans, such as baking bars by Guittard. Use full-fat coconut milk that* *does not contain additives or thickening agents* *\u2014 Riggs likes Trader Joe\u2019s Organic Coconut Milk or Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk Simple.*\n\n[Karla Walsh](https://karlawalsh.com/) is a Des Moines, Iowa-based freelance lifestyle writer with more than 16 years of editorial experience.\n\nRecipe adapted from \u201cIn Good Health: Uncomplicated, Allergen-Aware Recipes for a Nourished Life\u201d by Rachel Riggs.

He often stands out among groups of federal officers as one of the few people not wearing a mask.\n\nOn social media, he\u2019s known for sharing photos and cinematic videos that tout Border Patrol agents\u2019 determination to carry out their mission.\n\nAnd now, his presence at the podium and on screens around the world is becoming more common as he delivers briefings from Minneapolis.\n\nThat\u2019s where Bovino stood hours after a Border Patrol officer shot and killed a man in that city Saturday, telling reporters that officers had followed their training when faced with an armed suspect who \u201cwanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.\u201d\n\nCritics quickly slammed Bovino\u2019s statement and others from Homeland Security officials, arguing that [videos of the shooting](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/24/us/invs-videos-show-federal-officer-recovered-gun) show no evidence the man was trying to harm anyone.\n\nBut Bovino doubled down on his defense of officers Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they\u2019re highly trained prevented any specific shootings of law enforcement, so good job for our law enforcement in taking him down before he was able to do that,\u201d Bovino [told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/politics/video/bovino-dana-bash-full-interview-digvid)\n\nPressed to provide evidence, Bovino said more details would emerge as authorities investigate and argued that the man was trying to impede officers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad the consequences had to be paid because he injected himself into that crime scene. I can\u2019t say that enough. He made the decision to go there,\u201d Bovino said.\n\nThe Border Patrol official\u2019s account drew sharp criticism Sunday morning from Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy.\n\n\u201cEverybody saw that video, and yet there he was telling you and telling the American public that this young man was brandishing a weapon, that he was impeding officers, that he was there to attend a riot, that he was engaged in assault, when everyone can see that that\u2019s not true,\u201d Murphy told CNN. \u201cIt should freak the American public out that the Trump administration lies this easily, will lie to your face when you can see the evidence for yourself.\u201d\n\nBovino is no stranger to criticisms of his approach. For months in interviews, court testimony and social media posts, he\u2019s repeatedly defended federal officers\u2019 actions and vowed not to back down.\n\nIn multiple social media posts and interviews, Bovino has repeatedly [used a phrase](https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/2010151928332706081?s=20) to describe his officers\u2019 tactics.\n\n\u201cHe calls them \u2018turn and burn,\u2019\u201d [CNN contributor Lulu Garcia-Navarro says](https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/ebo/date/2025-10-07/segment/01). \u201cThey\u2019re very rapid. They\u2019re very aggressive. Break windows, go in, grab people. And the reason he says that he does these tactics is to not put \u2026agents at risk, not to allow protests to develop.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the administration\u2019s aggressive mass deportation push see Bovino as a hero. But the forceful, unapologetic approach that\u2019s fueled his recent rise to prominence has also drawn fierce criticism from local leaders and protesters in cities his team is targeting.\n\nOfficials in several cities have described Bovino as leading a law enforcement agency which\u202f[deploys tactics](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/07/politics/video/gregory-bovino-border-patrol-aggressive-tactics-vrtc)\u202fthat are frighteningly authoritarian and used by the president as a cudgel against Democrat-led communities and the people \u2014 citizens and noncitizens alike \u2014 who live in them.\n\n\u201cThey want mayhem on the ground,\u201d Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker [told CNN in October](https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/sotu/date/2025-10-05/segment/01), accusing Bovino and other federal officials of deliberately inflaming tensions. \u201cThey want to create the war zone, so that they can send in even more troops.\u201d\n\n[Heavy-handed tactics](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/25/us/masks-arrests-ice-tactics-immigration), including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled alarm, including among some in the Trump administration, while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials.\n\nAsked about the aggressive approach that has spurred growing criticism and protests, Bovino has defended his officers.\n\n\u201cYou know, folks are free to criticize. They\u2019re free to\u202farmchair\u202fquarterback. When they don\u2019t walk a mile in the shoes of law enforcement, then they might want to think a second before full-blown criticism. I\u2019ve heard a lot of that,\u201d [he told CNN in October](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/07/politics/video/gregory-bovino-border-patrol-aggressive-tactics-vrtc). \u201cOur officers act legally, ethically and morally in all law enforcement actions.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Murphy said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the latest shooting in Minneapolis should spur lawmakers to press for reforms within the Department of Homeland Security before approving its budget.\n\n\u201cPeople being killed simply for exercising their First Amendment rights is going to be a regular feature in this country. That is dystopian. We shouldn\u2019t allow for it, and that should unite Republicans and Democrats in Congress, because it\u2019s increasingly uniting Republicans and Democrats all around the country who are turning against this just unbelievably lawless way that Bovino and his team are operating in our cities,\u201d he said.\n\nBovino\u2019s [presence in different cities](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/13/us/charlotte-gregory-bovino-border-patrol) across the country in recent months has become an unofficial barometer of how intense immigration enforcement is expected to get.\n\nThese days, Bovino is a frequent sight on the streets of Minneapolis \u2013 bringing what he calls the \u201cMean Green Team\u201d thousands of miles from the sector along the US-Mexico border where he was stationed before.\n\n\u201cThe [#MeanGreen](https://x.com/hashtag/MeanGreen?src=hashtag_click) is patrolling Minneapolis through the cold, through the snow, and through it all arresting illegal aliens until the mission is accomplished,\u201d Bovino posted Friday on X. \u201cWe\u2019re here and we\u2019re making the city safe.\u201d\n\nOriginally from North Carolina, Bovino joined the Border Patrol in 1996. His 30-year career has taken him from Washington to New Orleans as well as foreign postings in Honduras and Africa. In 2020 he was named Chief Patrol Agent of the El Centro Sector of Southern California.\n\nIn 2023, Bovino was briefly relieved of command from his position in what House Republicans described as a retaliatory measure after he testified critically about conditions along the border under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.\u202f[The Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/gregory-bovino-immigration-takeaways-282bcb88d370a77e5188ef97931aff6e)\u202fother factors were also at play \u2013 including his social-media presence and an online profile picture of him posing with an assault rifle.\n\nHe began drawing public attention last summer, when he helped orchestrate the arrests of more than 5,000 immigrants in a Los Angeles operation. Since then, Bovino \u2013 who\u2019s in his mid-fifties \u2013 has led sweeps in Chicago, Charlotte, New Orleans and, now, Minneapolis.\n\nBovino\u2019s conduct during the Chicago operation drew stern rebukes from a federal judge, who ruled that [his descriptions of events weren\u2019t supported by video evidence](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/us/gregory-bovino-deposition-chicago-immigration).\n\nIn one video, cited in a federal court case alleging excessive force against protesters in Chicago, the judge ruled that Bovino \u201cobviously tackles\u201d a protester on camera. But in his deposition, Bovino denied he tackled the man. \u201cI\u2019m imploring (him)\u2026to comply with leaving the area to comply with instructions,\u201d Bovino said, adding, \u201cthe use of force was against me.\u201d\n\nLately, another aspect of Bovino\u2019s image is also drawing attention: the long green trench coach he sometimes wears.\n\n\u201cGreg Bovino dressed up as if he literally went on eBay and purchased SS garb. Greg Bovino, secret police, private army, masked men, people disappearing quite literally, no due process,\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom said recently, drawing a comparison to Nazi uniforms.\n\nBovino says he\u2019s had the jacket for more than 25 years, and got it from the Border Patrol.\n\n\u201cI bought that as a young agent, approximately 1999,\u201d [he told News Nation](https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/2015077205236146510?s=20), noting that he was also photographed wearing it for a ceremony during the Biden administration.\n\nThat interview, Bovino wrote on social media, \u201ccleared up any misconceptions and highlighted the double standard phenomenon.\u201d\n\nWhatever happens next, there\u2019s little doubt we\u2019ll be seeing more of Bovino \u2013 and his coat \u2013 on America\u2019s streets.\n\nSlickly produced videos and other social media posts from Bovino\u2019s accounts have also drawn criticism. He says the posts are aimed at increasing transparency.\n\n\u201cThis is not agenda-driven. Our social media is designed to give the public \u2026 a real-time snapshot of what is really happening,\u201d\u202f[Bovino told CNN in October](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/politics/gregory-bovino-border-patrol-chicago-immigration).\n\nAmong his recent posts, [Bovino shared a video clip](https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/2014370486151508278?s=20) of his response during a press briefing to a reporter who asked when the surge of federal law enforcement into Minneapolis will end.\n\n\u201cIs there a certain number of people you want to apprehend before you decide to ease the surge?\u201d the reporter asked.\n\n\u201cThere is a number,\u201d Bovino said, \u201cand it\u2019s called all of them.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez, Michael Williams, Dianne Gallagher and Zoe Sottile contributed to this report.",

The Memphis area is under a winter storm warning until 6 p.m., [according to the National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/meg/).

It trails just behind March 30, 2020, which saw 12,143 cancellations during the early days of the Covid pandemic shutdowns, according to aviation analytics company Cirium.\n\nMore than [4,100 flights were canceled](https://www.flightaware.com/live/cancelled/yesterday) Saturday as the storm ramped up, and another [2,200 have already been canceled](https://www.flightaware.com/live/cancelled/tomorrow) on Monday, a number which is expected to continue rising.\n\nNew York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport is closed, according to multiple alerts from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nAn FAA Notice to Airmen issued at 1:05 p.m. EST says the airport will remain closed until 8 p.m. EST.\n\nA publicly available FAA operations plan says LaGuardia is closed \u201cas the airport authority treats runways.\u201d\n\nThe latest aviation weather report from LaGuardia shows low visibility and heavy blowing snow.\n\nAs of 2 p.m. EST, FlightAware shows that 91% of all flights out of LaGuardia have been canceled, along with 97% of arriving flights.\n\nLehigh Valley International Airport in Pennsylvania is closed because of the weather, the airport posted to X.\n\nIt\u2019s one of [several US airports to close](https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/winter-storm-forecast-snow-ice-01-25-26-climate?post-id=cmktvd19000053b6tp29f4rjo) since Saturday\u2019s [record-high number of flight cancellations](https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/winter-storm-forecast-snow-ice-01-25-26-climate?post-id=cmktpobsq00003b6w9yhz6cu3).\n\nThe Lehigh Valley airport canceled 14 flights in the past 24 hours, [FlightAware data](https://www.flightaware.com/live/airport/KABE) shows.\n\nPower poles snapped as ice accumulates on power lines\n\n00:37\n\n\u2022 Source:\n\n[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/)\n\nPower poles snapped as ice accumulates on power lines\n\n00:37\n\nNew footage from storm chaser Brandon Clement shows just how devastating this winter storm\u2019s ice has been for power infrastructure in Mississippi.\n\nPower pole after power pole is snapped at the base by the weight of the ice, which is so thick on the lines still standing, it makes them look like ghastly, translucent ropes, drooping on their own in midair.\n\nSnow is piling up in Ohio as the massive storm continues to generate significant totals on its northern side.\n\nA huge stripe of 6 to 10 inches of snow has already fallen from Cincinnati through Columbus to near Youngstown, along the border with Pennsylvania. A few locations around the Dayton and Springfield areas in the western portion of the state have picked up a foot of snow.\n\nThe snow is wreaking havoc on area roadways. Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther [urged residents](https://x.com/ColumbusGov/status/2015471441928483038?s=20) to avoid all travel while the city is under a Level 3 Snow Emergency.\n\n\u201cIt is really, really dangerous out there,\u201d Ginther said in a video posted to social media on Sunday. \u201cYou should be at home unless there is an absolute emergency.\u201d\n\nThe Ohio State University\u2019s Columbus campus canceled in-person classes for Monday and Tuesday due to the heavy snow. \u201cWe anticipate classes and normal campus operations resuming on Wednesday, January 28, unless weather conditions dictate otherwise,\u201d the university [said in a news alert](https://news.osu.edu/ohio-state-news-alert-columbus-campus-weather-update/).\n\nRichard Wayner had to get his running miles in Sunday despite the heavy snowfall and bitter cold blanketing New York City.\n\nWayner was on his seventh mile near Central Park as snow was rapidly coming down, with frozen eyelashes and eyebrows covered in frost. \u201cI feel like when it snows, everything kind of slows down,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cEverything is calm, the city gets quiet \u2014 it\u2019s like you\u2019re in the forest now.\u201d\n\nFor UPS worker Tyrell Lewis, the feeling was one of relief as he headed back home after working outdoors ahead of the storm. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy out here. I\u2019m sick of it,\u201d Lewis said, adding he plans on staying home tomorrow in the aftermath of the storm.\n\nA handful of runners, dog walkers and curious New Yorkers were the only dark specks in the sea of white snow covering Central Park.\n\nFor Mick Bonde, going outside was more of an obligation: He was walking his dog.\n\n\u201cThis is what I was expecting,\u201d Bonde said of the snow. \u201cI went to bed last night and I didn\u2019t see a whole lot, so I\u2019m glad to see that there\u2019s something accumulating and sticking to the ground.\u201d\n\nWatch: A drive through West Orange, New Jersey, as snow blankets the area\n\n00:33\n\n\u2022 Source:\n\n[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/)\n\nWatch: A drive through West Orange, New ...\n\n00:33\n\nVideo captured by photojournalist Rod Griola shows snow-covered roads and neighborhoods in West Orange, New Jersey, as the storm moves through the area.\n\nDamage from ice is widespread in the college town of Oxford, Mississippi, with trees and power lines buckling from the storm.\n\nOxford is in Lafayette County, where about 75% of its more than 26,000 electric customers have no power as of 1:15 p.m. ET, making it the worst hit county in the state, according to [PowerOutage.us](https://poweroutage.us/area/state/mississippi).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous situation,\u201d said [North East Mississippi Electric Power Association](https://x.com/NorthEastPower/status/2015416935417016614) CEO & General Manager Keith Hayward. \u201cMost of our system is on the ground or has trees or damage already.\u201d\n\nOxford Utilities said \u201cdamage is widespread in Oxford and on our neighboring utility systems\u201d in a post on X.\n\n[Oxford Police warned](https://x.com/OxfordPolice/status/2015448061707800609) there were active power lines down across Highway 7 and that several people had driven over those live lines. \u201cPlease stay home unless it\u2019s an absolute emergency,\u201d [police said](https://x.com/OxfordPolice/status/2015441010482942063).\n\nThe University of Mississippi has already canceled classes for Tuesday given the \u201c[significant disruption](https://x.com/OleMiss/status/2015473103917527506)\u201d to the community due to power outages and unsafe roads.\n\nWatch: Water main break shuts down stretch of Highway 51 south of Charlotte\n\n00:26\n\n\u2022 Source:\n\n[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/)\n\nWatch: Water main break shuts down stretch of ...\n\n00:26\n\nA water main break in Pineville, North Carolina, just south of Charlotte, in freezing temperatures shut down portion of highway after it turned everything to ice, according to CNN affiliate WSOC.\n\nThe Pineville Police Department in North Carolina says a section of Highway 51, was shut down Sunday morning after the pipe broke. It has since reopened, WSOC reported.\n\nTemperatures dropped to around 18 degrees overnight in the Charlotte area, which is about 15 degrees colder than a normal late January night.\n\nThe city is still only hovering around 20 degrees early Sunday afternoon.\n\nFirefighters battle blaze among freezing temperatures\n\nFirefighters battle house fire amid freezing temperatures and surrounded by snow in Oklahoma City.\n\n00:51\n\n\u2022 Source:\n\n[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/)\n\nFirefighters battle blaze among freezing ...\n\n00:51\n\nA house in southeast Oklahoma City was \u201calmost totally engulfed\u201d by flames and smoke and surrounded by snow from the storm on Sunday, according to CNN affiliate KOCO News 5.\n\nThe home\u2019s two occupants had reported a fire in their garage and were able to escape, according to Oklahoma City fire department spokesperson Scott Douglas. No injuries were reported, but the fire caused \u201csignificant damage\u201d to the garage and attic, as well as smoke damage throughout the home, Douglas said.\n\nThe fire department is currently investigating the cause of the fire, he said.\n\nThe Oklahoma City fire department was on the scene in challenging conditions, working to get water to douse the flames. It\u2019s currently 8 degrees in the area, and the high temperature for today is only 13 degrees. Winds are blowing at 10-15 miles per hour with gusts up to 25 mph.\n\nThose winds could hinder fire crews but are also dropping the wind chill into the single digits below zero. Wind chills could get to -11 or -12 around midnight.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani encouraged people to stay indoors and watch \u201chorrible reality TV\u201d as heavy snow continues to blanket the city.\n\n\u201cWe are frankly seeing too many New Yorkers still out on the roads. That\u2019s actually impeding the ability for sanitation to meet this moment,\u201d Mamdani said told CNN, standing near the frozen Harlem Meer in Central Park.\n\nSnow is falling steadily, covering streets, sidewalks and cars in powdery frost. It is also bitterly cold and windy, making conditions increasingly dangerous if there is prolonged exposure.\n\n\u201cThis is still going to be the coldest period that New Yorkers have seen for the last 8 years,\u201d Mamdani said.\n\nThere are thousands of sanitation workers out on city streets and plows have started to clear roadways. The city has also opened 10 warming centers across the five boroughs for anyone in need of shelter and heated space.\n\nMamdani said the city\u2019s sanitation workforce has been increased from 2,000 workers to 2,500 working 12-hour shifts.\n\n\u201cThese are those people who\u2019ll be doing the work in the moment and the ones who\u2019ll be cleaning up after the fact,\u201d Mamdani said. \u201cStay home, find some horrible reality TV \u2013 today\u2019s the day.\u201d\n\nThe massive winter storm has covered more than 1,800 miles of the US from the Rockies to the East Coast in snow and ice since Friday.\n\n[See more photos from the storm.](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/24/weather/gallery/winter-storm)",
